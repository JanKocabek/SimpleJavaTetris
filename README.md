## 📖 Overview

**TetrisEngine** is more than just a clone; it is a robust implementation focusing on clean OOP principles and game architecture. By strictly adhering to the **Official Tetris Guidelines** (including the **Super Rotation System**), this engine provides a smooth and competitive gameplay experience.

The ultimate goal is to evolve this project into a **Tetris-ARPG**, introducing progression, skill trees, and monster-battling mechanics through row clears.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🏗️ **Standard Rotation System (SRS):** Full implementation of wall-kicks and rotation logic.
- ⚡ **Responsive Input:** Low-latency keyboard handling using Swing Key Bindings.
- 📐 **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation of Model, View, and Controller (MVC).
- 🧩 **Standard Tetrominoes:** All 7 official shapes (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z) with correct colors.
- 📊 **Scoring System:** Basic scoring to track your performance.
- ⏸️ **Game Flow:** Integrated Pause and GameOver states.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

*   **Scalability:** Refactoring the engine to use modular composition, allowing for the easy addition of "ARPG" features like skill trees and power-ups.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensuring all rotations, wall-kicks, and lock-out timings strictly follow official Tetris guidelines.
*   **Performance:** Moving toward a multi-threaded architecture to ensure smooth 60FPS rendering independent of game logic calculations.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 📋 Prerequisites
*   **Java 21** or higher.
*   **Maven** (optional, for building from source).

### ⚙️ Execution
1.  **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/JavaSwingTetris.git
    ```
2.  **Build with Maven:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    ```
3.  **Run the JAR:**
    ```bash
    java -jar target/TetrisEngine.jar
    ```
    *Alternatively, run `org.sehes.tetris.Main` directly from your IDE.*
